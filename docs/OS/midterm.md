    - Is SJF always better than RR, for any time quantum, in terms of the average turnaround time?(6pts)

        <span style="color:red">Yes. ***Proof***:

        <span style="color:red">WLOG, given processes $P_1$, $P_2$, $\dots$, $P_n$ with CPU burst time $t_1$, $t_2$, $\dots$, $t_n$, where $t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_n$.
        
        <span style="color:red">By SJF, their turnaround time should be:

        <span style="color:red">\begin{array}{c|c}
        P_i & \text{waiting time} \\\\
        \hline
        P_1 & t_1 \\\\
        P_2 & t_1 + t_2 \\\\
        P_3 & t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\\\
        \vdots & \vdots \\\\
        P_n & t_1 + t_2 + \cdots + t_n
        \end{array}
        
        <span style="color:red">Total waiting time:

        <span style="color:red">$$nt_1 + (n - 1)t_2 + \cdots + t_n.$$

        <span style="color:red">Obviously, this sum is minimized if $t_i$'s that are multiplied more times are smaller ones, i.e., 
            
        <span style="color:red">$$t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_n.$$

        <span style="color:red">Thus, in non-preemptive scheduling, SJF (actually Shortest-next-CPU-burst-first) is optimal for the purpose of minimizing turnaround time.

    - When all processes are of the same size, please tell us what the best time quantum is for RR in terms of the average waiting time. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">$80\%$ of the CPU bursts should be shorter than the time quantum.

    - Now suppose that processes might arrive at different times, and SJF and RR are preemptive scheduling algorithms. Is SJF always better than RR, for any time quantum, in terms of the average waiting time. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">Similar to 5.(a).

(Hint: (1) the Bakery Algorithm; (2) Each process denotes an airplane.) (10pts)

    ```c
    int number[i];          // Pi's number if it is nonzeros
    boolean choosing[i];    // Pi is taking a number
    ```

    ```c
    do {
        choosing[i] = true;         // A process want to enter its critical section
        number[i] = max(number[0], ..., number[n - 1]) + 1;
        choosing[i] = false;        // A process has got its number
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            while (choosing[j]) ;
            while (number[j] != 0 && (number[j], j) < (number[i], i)) ;     // If two processes got the same number, then we should compare their indices
        }
        /* critical section */

        number[i] = 0;
        /* remainder section */
    } while (true);
    ```

What is the advantage in using a stack, compared with the approach in using a fixed space for each interrupt type? (5pts)

        <span style="color:red">If there are 2 interrupts, using fixed space is bad since the address of the first interrupted will be covered by later interrupted process.

    <span style="color:red">

8. Consider the scheduling of processes in which processes might arrive at different times and have different deadlines to complete their execution. Let the processes be scheduled by the preemptive Shortest-Job-First algorithm (PSJF) and a Priority Scheduling algorithm (PS) in which processes with urgent deadlines have higher priorities, and there is only one processor. Can you give a set of processes such that PS can meet the deadlines of the processes, but PSJF can not do it? (5pts)

    <span style="color:red">Given processes:

9. Consider the Round Robin scheduling algorithm (RR) with two different time quantums $L$ and $S$, where $L > S$. Let the scheduling criteria be the average waiting time, and $L$ be larger than the largest CPU burst of all processes. Does RR, in general, favor a small time quantum $S$ when all processes are ready at time $0$? Please give me your answer with argument. (7pts)

    <span style="color:red">No. For example, given processes $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ with CPU burst time $10$, $10$ and $10$

    - <span style="color:red">With quantum $> 10 (L)$, average waiting time = (0 + (10 - 0) + (20 - 0)) / 3 = 30 / 10 = 10.
    - <span style="color:red">With quantum $= 5$, average waiting time = [0 + (15 - 5) + (5 - 0) + (20 - 10) + (10 - 0) + (25 - 15)] = 45 / 3 = 15.
    - <span style="color:red">With quantum $= 1$, average waiting time = ... = (18 + 19 + 20) / 3 = 19.
    - <span style="color:red">With quantum $\to 0$, average waiting time $\approx$ (20 + 20 + 20) / 3 = 20.

    <span style="color:red">It is obvious that smaller time slice will lead a longer average waiting time.

    - For multiple cores, do we prefer kernel-level threads or user-level threads? Why? (3pts) [Fall 2013 6.(b)]

        <span style="color:red">We prefer kernel-level threads because we look for parallelism to better utilize multiple cores of a system.

    - There are also challenges in programming. Consider merge sorting, in which an unsorted list is divided into $N$ sublists, each containing $1$ element, and then we repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only $1$ sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. Please use the concept of task parallelism to execute the merge sort over $N$ cores. (5pts)

(5pts) [Spring 2011 5.(a)]

        <span style="color:red">Yes. ***Proof***:

        <span style="color:red">WLOG, given processes $P_1$, $P_2$, $\dots$, $P_n$ with CPU burst time $t_1$, $t_2$, $\dots$, $t_n$, where $t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_n$.
        
        <span style="color:red">By SJF, their waiting time should be:

        <span style="color:red">\begin{array}{c|c}
        P_i & \text{waiting time} \\\\
        \hline
        P_1 & 0 \\\\

        P_3 & t_1 + t_2 \\\\
        \vdots & \vdots \\\\
        P_n & t_1 + t_2 + \cdots + t_{n - 1}

        <span style="color:red">Total waiting time:

        <span style="color:red">$$(n - 1)t_1 + (n - 2)t_2 + \cdots + t_{n - 1}.$$

        <span style="color:red">Obviously, this sum is minimized if $t_i$'s that are multiplied more times are smaller ones, i.e., 
            
        <span style="color:red">$$t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_{n - 1} < t_n.$$

        <span style="color:red">Thus, in non-preemptive scheduling, SJF (actually Shortest-next-CPU-burst-first) is optimal for the purpose of minimizing average waiting time.

    - Suppose that the variance of the waiting time is the criterion in process scheduling. Shall we have a small time slice for a better variance for Round-Robin Scheduling when all processes of the same CPU burst arrive at time $0$? (5pts) [Fall 2011 9., Fall 2013, 7.(c)]

        <span style="color:red">No. For example, given processes $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ with CPU burst time $10$, $10$ and $10$

        - <span style="color:red">With quantum $= 10$, average waiting time = (0 + (10 - 0) + (20 - 0)) / 3 = 30 / 10 = 10.
        - <span style="color:red">With quantum $= 5$, average waiting time = [0 + (15 - 5) + (5 - 0) + (20 - 10) + (10 - 0) + (25 - 15)] = 45 / 3 = 15.
        - <span style="color:red">With quantum $= 1$, average waiting time = ... = (18 + 19 + 20) / 3 = 19.
        - <span style="color:red">With quantum $\to 0$, average waiting time $\approx$ (20 + 20 + 20) / 3 = 20.

        <span style="color:red">It is obvious that smaller time slice will lead a longer average waiting time.

    - Please compare the difference between a binary semaphore and a condition variable. (3pts) [Fall 2012 7.]

        <span style="color:red">The signal operation of a condition variable resumes one suspended process. If there is none, no effect is imposed.

    - Please use Monitor to implement Consumer and Producer with a bounded buffer. (10pts)

            void consumer() {

                counter--;
                signal(empty);
            }
        }
        ```

        - <span style="color:red">counter: number of filled slots
        - <span style="color:red">empty: buffer has at least one empty slot
        - <span style="color:red">full: buffer has at lesat one full slot
        
    - Please prove that your above solution satisfy the Progress requirement of the Critical Section Problem. (3pts)

        - <span style="color:red">Mutual exclusioin: monitor ensures that only one process can execute.
        - <span style="color:red">Progress requirement: by signal(full) to wake wait(full) and signal(empty) to wake wait(empty), the processes won't wait forever.
        - <span style="color:red">Bounded-waiting: they will both at most wait for 1 process (each other).

        <span style="color:red">Transfer the creation and management of the threading from the application developers to compilers and run-time libraries.

2. For the implementation of the UNIX process control block PCB[]， we have proc[] and .u, which contain different attributes for different purposes (e.g., those must be known regardless of whether the process is running). Which one is in the kemel or user address space? Are they both in the kemel or user address space? Which one of proc[] and .u signal disposition resides? Where thread-specific data/thread local storage will reside (in the kemel or user address space)? (8pts)

    - kernel address space: proc[]; user-address space: .u
    - .u: signal disposition.
    - user address space.

3. Please answer the following questions regarding operating systems: (21pts)

    - When timing sharing appears as a feature for operating systems, please tell us two emerging features/subsystems, beside job synchronization. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">one-line file systems, virtual memory, sophisticated CPU scheduling.

    - Virtual machine software provides an interface that is identical to the underlying bare hardware. I/O over a virtual machine could be slow or fast, depending on the implementations. Please give me a case in which I/O is fast, compared to I/O directly over physical devices. (5pts)

        <span style="color:red">I/O can be fast over a hard disk when the corresponding disk is implemented over DRAM by emulation.

    - There are operating system services, such as program executions, I/O operations, accounting, resource allocation, e汀or detection. Which one is belonging to those for user convenience? Which one is belonging to those for system efficiency? (1Opts)

        <span style="color:red">user convenience: program executions, I/O operations, error detection; system efficiency: accounting, resource allocation.

4. Multithreading is important for multi-core architectures. Please answer the following questions: (12pts)

    - Task parallelism is one typical parallelism type. Please give one example for task parallelism. (5pts)

        <span style="color:red">Run merge sorting over cores by partitioning data.

    - Please provide two challenges in multicore programming. (4pts)

        <span style="color:red">Identifying Tasks — Dividing Activities, Balance, Data Splitting, Data Dependency, Testing and Debugging.

    - Why the context switching cost of kernel-level threads is higher than that of user-level threads. (3pts)

        <span style="color:red">Context switching cost is a little bit higher because the kernel must do the switching.

5. Compare preemptive scheduling and non-preemptive scheduling. Please answer the following questions: (21 pts)

    - In what circumstance, non-preemptive scheduling wiU be be吐er than preemptive scheduling? (4pts)

        <span style="color:red">Non-preemptive scheduling could be better than preemptive scheduling when all jobs are ready together at time 0.

    - The selection of CPU scheduling algorithms should consider the scheduling criteria. If the high Thoughput is the criterion, which one is the best: Shortest job first, FIFO, and round-robin scheduling. You must provide answer to get credits. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">shortest job first.

    - Priority scheduling is a framework for scheduling. Please design a priority assignment formula that gives a lower priority to a job when it runs more time. (5pts)

        <span style="color:red">priority = 1 / consumed-CPU-time.

    - For Round-Robin Scheduling, if the lower average Tumaround Time is the criterion, sha11 we prefer a lower time slice? Suppose that a11 jobs are ready at time O. You must provide answer to get credits. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">a lower time slice is bad to the low average turnaround time.

6. Processor Affinity is somehow against push migration. Please explain why. (6pts)

    <span style="color:red">It is because of the cost in cache repopulation.

7. Please explain the progress assumption concerns for virtualization. (6pts)

    <span style="color:red">lt is assumed that a certain amount of progress should be observed for a system in a given amount oftime under virtualization.


8. Consider solutions to the Critical Section Problem. Please answer the following questions (14pts)

    - Consider a computing server to service jobs from three FIFO queues in a round robin way whenever there are jobs in any non-empty queues. Please use semaphores to implement your solution with some pseudo code. (6pts)

        <span style="color:red">We let the dispatcher of each job queue to wait a shared semaphore whenever it has a pending job. Let the semaphore have a FIFO queue.

    - What is the difference between a binary, semaphore and a condition variable? (3pts)

        <span style="color:red">A conditino variable has nothing happening to a signal request if no job is waiting for the variable.

    - The Monitor-based implementation of the Dining Philosopher problem in the textbook implements the idea of two-chop-stick-per-time solution. Will it have the starvation problem? You must provide explanation to receive credits. (5pts)

        <span style="color:red">Yes, the starvation problem happens to a philosopher whenever his two neighboring philosophers take turn in eating while he is waiting.
