# Operating System | notes

In this page, I'll work on my notes when I have class of [Operating System, Spring 2018](http://newslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/course/OS2018/index.php) by Professor [Tei-Wei Kuo](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~ktw/eng-index.htm). Professor Kuo has also upload the course videos to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLco3ZjBUnBUKNn0ANhQ1N7aJbYUmMlgc8).

The materials are mainly from the [Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz-ebook/dp/B00APSZCEQ).
