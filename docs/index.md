# Computer Science Notes

## Getting Started

In this website, I'll work on my notes about several topics:

- [Operating System](https://walkccc.github.io/CS/OS/)
- [Maching Learning](https://walkccc.github.io/CS/ML/)

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents.

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) is now supporting more functions and is much faster than [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), I've updated all math equations from MathJax to KaTeX.

I also add `overflow-x: auto` to prevent the overflow issue on small screen devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.
